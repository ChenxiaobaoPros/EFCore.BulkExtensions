Copy all 6 folders and .props file from this folder into root directory.
That way .csproj files in their respective folder would be overridden with these ones that have .net8 target and dependencies.
Optionally check dependencies for updates but only of minor versions, e.g. 8.0.1 to 8.0.2 (do Not upgrade to 9.x).
Then build and publish nugets.
Afterwards do not commit changes, instead stash them (discard changes) or delete local repo and clone it again, since main branch should remain on latest version.
